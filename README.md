# nixos-dark-wallpaper
A dark wallpaper with many NixOS logos.

I made this by hand in Inkscape, so the logos are not aligned perfectly, but it should be good enough. The wallpaper is square and big enough to cover basically every screen.

There is also a Thinkpad version with a red NixOs logo in the center.
